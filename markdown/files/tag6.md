At first half of a day I finished with site's design. I have found it in internet and download. You can find source [here](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/bootstrap-sidebar-04/) 

At second half of the day we bought a domain and a server, that would use to make my site acsessable in Internet. Also I started se it up, installed nginx and SSL certifikate.
